# WE Adafruit FeatherWings

[Adafruit Feather](https://www.adafruit.com/feather) is a complete line of development boards from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/) and other developers that are both standalone and stackable. They're able to be powered by [LiPo batteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_polymer_battery) for on-the-go use or by their [micro-USB](https://www.we-online.de/katalog/de/em/connectors/input_output_connectors/wr-com) plugs for stationary projects. Feathers are flexible, portable, and as light as their namesake.

[FeatherWings](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather/featherwings) are stacking boards and add functionality and room for prototyping. At its core, the Adafruit Feather is a complete ecosystem of products - and the best way to get your project flying.

[Würth Elektronik eiSos](https://www.we-online.de/web/en/wuerth_elektronik/start.php) presents FeatherWings that are **open source** and **fully compatible** with the **Feather form factor**. Through these development boards WE brings a range of wireless connectivity modules, sensors and power modules to the Feather ecosystem.

Hypercharge your prototyping for easy and fast solution testing.
