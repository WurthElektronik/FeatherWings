# Calypso Wi-Fi FeatherWing

## Introduction

The WÃ¼rth Elektronik eiSos [Calypso Wi-Fi FeatherWing](https://www.we-online.de/katalog/en/CALYPSO_FeatherWing) is a development board that offers a secure 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi connectivity solution. It is fully compatible to the popular [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/) [Feather line](https://www.adafruit.com/feather) of development boards and extends the Feathers with Wi-Fi connectivity.

The Calypso Wi-Fi FeatherWing consists of the [Calypso radio module](https://www.we-online.com/catalog/en/CALYPSO) that offers Wi-Fi connectivity based on **IEEE 802.11 b/g/n** with a fully featured TCP/IP stack. With out-of-the-box support to commonly used network applications like **SNTP**, **HTTP(S)**, **MQTT(S)**, Calypso offers easy and secure solutions to any **IoT application**.

| ------- | ------- |----------------|
|    0	| 0  |	AT command normal mode |
|    0	|1 |	FOTA update mode |
|    1	| 0 |	Provisioning mode |
|    1	|1 |	AT command terminal mode |

#### Jumper JP3
This jumper allows the connection of Calypso pins APP_MODE_0, APP_MODE_1, WAKE_UP to the host microcontroller. Additionally, it allows the general purpose switch S2 to be connected to GPIO 12.

| Pin connection | Function  | Jumper set (Default) |
| ------- | ------- |----------------|
|    1,2|	S2 to GPIO12|	Yes|
|    3,4|	APP_MODE_0 to GPIOA1|	No|
|    5,6|	APP_MODE_1 to GPIOA2|	No|
|    7,8|	WAKE_UP to GPIO6|	No|

![Push buttons](docs/assets/switches.png)
#### Push button S1
This push button is connected to the /RESET pin of the Calypso Wi-Fi module. Pressing this button resets the module.

#### Push button S2
S2 is a general purpose push button which is connected to GPIO 12 when a jumper is set between pins 1 and 2 of JP3. This switch can be used to trigger a specific action like switching the Calypso into provisioning mode.
